# belly-button-challenge
This assignment was about creating interactive dashboards using JavaScript. More specifically, the D3 library was used in order to select, manipulate and visualize data. The dataset used can be found here: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/

The dashboard contains a dropdown menu to select the different samples and displays a bar and bubble plot as well as some metadata. As and when a new sample is selected from the dropdown menu, the plots and metadata panel content are updated to only show data related to the sample selected.

Resources used:
For arranging the plot in descending order: https://codepen.io/etpinard/pen/KZWyZv?editors=0010
For obtaining key-value pairs for the metadata and for its for loop : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries
